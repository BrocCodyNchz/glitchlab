objective: "Update the Controller's test execution logic to support a recursive retry loop on failure."
steps:
  - "Modify glitchlab/controller.py to catch test failures."
  - "Integrate a call to the DebuggerAgent when a failure is caught."
  - "Pass the stdout/stderr from the failed test as context to the Debugger."
  - "Apply the Debugger's suggested surgical blocks and re-run tests."
constraints:
  - "Limit retries to 3 attempts to prevent infinite loops and budget exhaustion."
  - "Use the existing surgical_blocks infrastructure for all fixes."
risk: high
